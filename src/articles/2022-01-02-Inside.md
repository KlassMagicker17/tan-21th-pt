There are bits of context to why I think this counts as literature. It moves people, it makes people feel. Bo Burnham may be a comedian on paper, but he is an artist at heart. He doesn't just tell jokes that makes you think, that's more George Carlin's style. No, he tells his jokes through songs that make you think, be introspective.

But the only true context is to see it for yourself. [Here's him performing one of his songs for MAKE HAPPY about his relationship with his audience.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYy0o-J0x20&ab_channel=boburnham) This is only a slice of what he does. If this is what a single song of his can do, what does an entire hour do?

I've followed Bo Burnham for some time now. Not as early as some, but early enough to remember myself humming to myself to the tune of "Kill Yourself". Funny stuff. But when he started having panic attacks on stage, he took a break. And a well deserved one at that. 

Fast forward a couple of years, the pandemic hit and reared its ugly head around the corner. To stave off the boredom that comes coupled with isolation, I went looking for something to watch when I thought, "I want to rewatch a Bo Burnham special." And so I typed into to Netflix's search bar "Bo". And there they were. Make Happy, what., and... Inside? What's Inside?

Of course, the first instinct is to watch it. While it loaded, I ended up searching the internet about it. Inside came out a few days after I found it. I was shook, both by how I accidentally found Inside without prompt, and also because Bo just released a new special! And so I watched it. Twice.

Never have I done that in my life. Movies and books are usually a one-and-done thing for. But not Inside. Inside was just so profound and amazing and funny and... Inside might possibly be Bo's magnum opus. But I wouldn't be surprised if he releases another special better than this. Not that he is obligated to.

But why is Inside so great?

Well first of all, it's relatable. Inside is about the pandemic. But not just the pandemic. Actually, the pandemic was never mentioned by name. Only ever alluded to. No, it was about **isolation**. Being alone, apart from people. Yeah sure I was with my family, but not with my friends. I've always been quiet and not the kind to strike up a conversation. I was fine for a while, maybe longer than others, but it did start to feel lonely. Thank God for Discord and public servers. But it's not just about being in solitude.

Inside is a lot of other things. About his personal struggles, about how companies conduct themselves online, about how we conduct ourselves online, about 🎵Jeffery Bezos🎵. It's contemporary comententary on almost everything we became more aware since the plague, seeing as we *have* to plug ourselves onto the world wide web to interact with people.

Aesthetically, Inside is very Bo Burnham-esque. It's his unique style. He plays with lighting in a way I have yet to see someone else do. [Here's a video on how he Bo uses light.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rLbMVlOH_k&ab_channel=NowYouSeeIt) Each new scene looked unique and different from the previous scene. Even if the floor is clutered with gizmos and wires--which really, just adds to the vibe of the entire thing--the lighting really takes all of those things out of mind. A very notable one that stuck with me is from the song "Problematic". He does this Jesus-cross thing, but the cross is not out of wood, but rather projected onto the wall behind him.

This project is shaping up in a weird way. I can't seem to express well enough on how great and wonderful and all other positive adjectives these pieces I'm picking for this miniblog thing. I think the best thing I can do is to simply link to them and get you to experience it for yourself instead. [Watch Inside here.](https://www.netflix.com/ph/title/81289483)
