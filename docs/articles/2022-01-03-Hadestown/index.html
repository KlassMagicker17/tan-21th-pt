    <article>
        <p>Hadestown is a modern retelling of the myth between the two lovers, Orpheus and Eurydice in a sort-of-but-not-really Depression Period. I've yet to watch a <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=slime%20tutorial">slime tutorial</a> of it, but I've listened to the entire album recording of it. Unlike most musicals, Hadestown is completely sung through, meaning there are no spoken lines (Well there are, but they're imbedded  into songs so I don't think those count.), meaning-meaning that you can get half the experience of being the theatre just by opening Spotify.</p>
<p>This musical might be my favorite out of all the musical I do listen to. But favorites are hard to quantify. A better metric would be by how many times I've listened to it. Now sadly, I'm not <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/a-simple-guide-to-visualising-your-spotify-listening-data-badass-ly">waiting for days</a> to get my Spotify listening habits, so instead I'll go with a more 'qualitative' approach.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How many often do you think that you listen to this album?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a lot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you elaborate?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Will you elaborate?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Um yeah sure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh you want me to elaborate <em>now</em>? Well, I think I started listening to Hadestown only a bit recently. Probably last summer. Or maybe the summer previous to that. Time flows weird in here house. Anyways, I probably listened to the entire 2-hour album at least thrice a week. I had other musicals that listened to, but Hadestown has got to be the one I listened to the most. Nowadays, I've been branching out, but I go back to Hadestown every so often.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that you know how obsessed I am with this musical, what makes it so appealing to me?</p>
<p>I like mythology, and Greek myths are the first set that I've found myself learning about. There is just something about the stories of old that my brain likes. A sort of history lesson, without actual real-world things. I have the same affinity for etymology; intangible things carrying culture intrinsically with them.</p>
<p>Hadestown combines two different Greek myths, Orpheus and Eurydice and Hades and Persephone (that maybe a <em>bit</em> wonky way of phrasing it.) The myth of Orpheus and Eurydice is about Orpheus's descent to the Underworld to rescue Eurydice but ultimately fail by looking behind. The myth of Hades and Persephone is about their strange marriage and union, and how their myth explains the seasons.</p>
<p>A little sidenote: the original myth of Hades and Persephone is totally, non-consensual. Hades asked Zeus for Persephone's hand in marriage, which was kind of the norm for marriages back then; women had little to no autonomy. Ancient Greece was a misogynistic place, but at least they had gay sex. Well not really, they had a sort of-</p>
<p>Not allowing myself to discuss any further sex in this Performance Task, back to Hades and Persephone. Yes, the original story is twisted, the modern story for this myth is much more cleaner. Hades and Persephone like each other, so they eloped, angering Demeter. This modernized version of the myth can also be found in Hades, a rougelite game where you play as Zagreus as he fights for freedom and have crazy amounts of s-</p>
<pre><code>NOT GOING THERE.

<p>Now that we have established that the relationship between Hades and Persephone in this musical is a consensual one, and not the def rape-y vibes the original gives, we can see something very clever here. Hadestown is effectively a double narrative. A double love story. And Anaïs makes this painfully clear.</p>
<p>The Gods love being one that has stagnated, and the mortals starting to stagnate. The couples loved each, and still do. But the men in the relationship (Hades and Orpheus) finds themselves focusing on the wrong things. In 'Chant', Persephone complains about the state of the underworld being so hot during Winter. (the musical also has environmental undertones, in shape of Hades, the super-capitalist man.) Hades rebuts with, &quot;Lover, when you feel that fire, think of it as my desire!&quot;</p>
<p>Clearly, if you have to show that your passion with a raging furnace, maybe you're compensating for something that has no fuel. Orpheus does something similar. In 'A Gathering Storm', Eurydice calls for Orpheus to help her prepare for the gathering storm, but he doesn't hear her. Instead, he pours he heart on his song, which in fairness, is supposed to heal the world. But he ignores her.</p>
<p>There are so many more parallels like this in the musical and there's no way I'm going to be able to point all of them out without writing an entire research paper on the topic. And I doubt I'll be first to make something like that. But a musical is not just made of story and parallelisms, it's also composed of music.</p>
<p>I cannot tell you how good this is. Literally. I don't have the talent nor skill to review music the way experts do. But I at least know when music isn't jarring. And this is definitely  not that. Jazz fan or not, this entire musical is just so good to listen to. I'll let their voices of vermouth rush down my throat.</p>
<p>So here: <a href="https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nIIe9IFWI7a6lsQfLQr5u7iUDKbSwsmUE&amp;feature=share">a YouTube Music link to listen to the musical in full.</a> Enjoy it. Savor it. Let their voices rush through your heart and soul. I promise you; you won't regret it.</p>
