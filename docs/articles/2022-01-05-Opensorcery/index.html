        <p>Oh gosh, another medium. But hey, at least this one you <em>actually</em> read. Open Sorcery plays as BEL/S, a sentient firewall program. The game is played through an entire eventful week, encountering other antagonistic spirits, and forming relationships with the people you protect.</p>
<p>I'm not going to lie; I didn't have money to buy this game when I learned about it. Instead, I pirated it like the greedy 15-year-old I was. But you can't put any blame on me, blame my younger self for having no impulse control. The main idea of the game is just too tempting to not play it. Like come on, programming <em>and</em> magic? What else can you want?</p>
<p>It is very self-evident why this game is attractive to me. I had fantasies of being able to program, so I ended up learning to do so early on for fun (program in asterisks, since I was playing around with HTML.) I felt so smart being able to open up the Window's default notepad, writing in some code I memorized, and opening the file in a browser, and seeing that it's all wrong, fixing it, then getting it to work. Programming in a nutshell.</p>
<p>Programming is close to my heart, and so is magic. I think it's a fair assessment that my liking for magic started when I watched anime. Pointing to one specific anime would be impossible--my memory is not very good this far back--but pointing to the Hero Channel is. The Hero Channel is Filipino Anime channel which I watched probably daily as a child. If I could have condensed that tv channel into a liquid, that stuff is going straight into my veins.</p>
<p>There. Magic and Programming, both very close to my heart. And that's why I love this game so much. It attracts me like a moth to a flame. It speaks to my childhood and inner child. I feel giddy playing this game. Open Sorcery is special and has a special place in my heart. I welcomed it like <em>insert clever metaphor here.</em></p>
<p>Magic in some animes (e.g. Full Metal Alchemist) is regarded as a science rather than magic. This is because for the characters in the universe, Alchemy is something that is studied and has rules it follows. But Abigail took that &quot;magic is science&quot; and spun it to &quot;magic is <em>computer</em> science.&quot;</p>
<p>It is a strange blend that you wouldn't think would work, but it does. It does it so well. The idea of magic being understood in the context of IT has been done before (research: NULL), but Open Sorcery takes this idea and plays with it so well. The references-turned-puns are just exquisite. HTML is Hypertext Magical Language, TCP is Telepathic Communications Protocol, firewall is literally out of fire.</p>
<p>The characters are so endearing. There's a depressed girl you get to befriend, a senior whose relatives are just waiting for her to die so that they can get that money, your creator's brother who you help overcome their fear of the dark. There are so more characters, but all of them are all so lovable (except for <strong>Her</strong>), and I want to hug each and every one of them.</p>
<p>There is no point trying to discuss any further because anything else <em>feels</em> like a spoiler. The game branches in narrative--for this is the nature of choose-your-own-adventure games--and there is just no way to talk about that without delving into the actual meat and story of the game.</p>
<p>No, I'll just have you play it. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/585180/Open_Sorcery/">Download Open Sorcery on Steam.</a> Or, you can pirate it. Not suggesting it though. But I'm not, not suggesting it.</p>
<pre><code>Warning: do not pirate her game. If the word of law will not suffice, 
then do this out of respect of Abigail Corfman.
